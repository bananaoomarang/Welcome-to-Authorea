\section{AMS -- Definitions, Theorems, Lemmas and more}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMS-LaTeX}{AMS-flavored} {\LaTeX} introduces a flexible language for declaring custom types of environments. It has long been the weapon of choice for declaring mathematical statements, for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
  % Declare in header.tex:
  \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
  \newtheorem{proof}{Proof}
  % ...
  % And later use:
  \begin{theorem}[Pythagoras] 
    Suppose $a\leq b\leq c$ are the side-lengths of a right triangle.\\  
    Then $a^2+b^2=c^2$.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Proof is left as an exercise to the reader.
  \end{proof}
\end{lstlisting}

  \begin{theorem}[Pythagoras] 
    Suppose $a\leq b\leq c$ are the side-lengths of a right triangle.\\  
    Then $a^2+b^2=c^2$.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
